\# ESP8266 WiFi Beacon Spam \& Captive Portal Ads



\## Overview



This project turns an ESP8266 into a WiFi access point named \*\*"Connect me!"\*\* that hosts a captive portal showing promotional ads or messages to connected users. At the same time, it broadcasts multiple fake WiFi SSIDs (beacon spam) to attract attention in the surrounding area.



Ideal for promotional events, pop-up shops, or targeted campaigns, users connecting to the \*\*"Connect me!"\*\* network are greeted instantly by your custom ad page — just like commercial WiFi hotspots do with captive portals.



\## Features



\- Real AP named \*\*"Connect me!"\*\* hosting a captive portal web server.

\- Customizable HTML ad page served automatically on connection.

\- Multiple fake WiFi SSIDs broadcasted for visibility (non-connectable).

\- Automatic redirect of all HTTP requests to the captive portal.

\- Compatible with captive portal detection on popular devices.



\## Usage



1\. Power your ESP8266 with this firmware.

2\. Users scan WiFi and see many fake SSIDs plus \*\*"Connect me!"\*\*.

3\. Connecting devices to \*\*"Connect me!"\*\* automatically see your ad landing page.

4\. Customize the ad content by editing the embedded HTML string in the source code.



\## Legal Notice



Use responsibly within legal frameworks and only on networks you own or have permission to test.
